# Daily-DSA-Practice-Java-C-LeetCode-Patterns
A structured repository for daily Data Structures &amp; Algorithms practice using Java and C++, based on LeetCode Daily Challenges and common interview patterns, with clear explanations and optimized solutions.
This repository focuses not just on solving problems, but on building **strong fundamentals**, writing **clean interview-ready code**, and documenting **clear reasoning and optimizations**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Maintain consistency with daily DSA practice
- Strengthen problem-solving skills
- Master commonly used DSA patterns
- Build a structured and reusable revision resource
- Demonstrate language-agnostic problem solving (Java & C++)

---

## 🧠 What This Repository Contains

### 📌 LeetCode Daily Challenges
- Problems solved daily from LeetCode
- Each problem includes:
  - Clear approach explanation
  - Time and space complexity
  - Edge cases and constraints
  - Interview insights and observations
- Solutions are implemented in **Java** and **C++**

### 📌 Pattern-Based Organization
In addition to daily tracking, selected problems are organized by common DSA patterns for faster revision:

- Two Pointers  
- Sliding Window  
- Prefix Sum  
- Binary Search  
- DFS / BFS  
- Dynamic Programming  

This helps in recognizing patterns rather than memorizing solutions.
